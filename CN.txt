Computer = Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research.

Day - 1: ARPA(Advance Research Proj Agency)
--------
1.Computer Network: Computer A connected with Computer B.
2.Internet : Collection of Computer Networks.
3.Fact:
   Country-Country Connection is through wired under Water.Not on Cloud or Air.
4.
   |Client| ---->  |Server|

   1.Client and Server can be your System when Application run on LocalHost.

5.Internet Society make all Rules/Protocols.
6.Protocols/Rules - How Data Moves from Source to Destination & ViceVersa.
    1.TCP : 100% Data Should reach Destination without Corruption or Data Loss.
    2.UDP : Dont care about Data Corruption or Loss. Ex : Video.
    3.Http : Web Uses Http.
7. Packets : If You want to large file Data. It sends in the form of Chunks or Packets.
8. IP Address : Suppose, if You type google.com, How it knows to reach out that Particular Google Server or Machine. It knows through Ip Address.
  
  To know IP Address : $ curl if config.me -s

     |[Device 1]| ---> |[Modem/Router]| ---> |[Google Server]|

   - Device 1 has Unique Private IP Address.
   - Modem(Internet Service Provider) has Public Address.
   
9. Port :
   - Ip Address helps to Identify which Device/Server to send Data.
   - Port Number helps to identify which Application to send Data in Device/Server.

   Ip Address - Represents Device/Server
   Port Number - Represents Application.

  Ports are 16-Bit.Total we have 2 power 16 = 65,000 Ports are Available.

  Http = 80
  MongoDB = 2707    => These are all Reserved Ports.
  Port : (1024 to 49152) for Application Purpose.
 
10. Internet Speed => 1 mbps = 1000000 bits/Second travel.

11.LAN:LOCAL AREA Network : Building/Office
   MAN:Metropolitan Area
   WAN : Wide Area : Across Countries ... SONET,FRAME RELAY

12. Modem : Convert Digital to Analog(ELECTRIC) signal.
    Router : send data to Registered IP Address.

13. ISP(internet Service Provider) : IN India, TATA is Tier 1 Provider. 
          Next we have Airtel,Jio.

14. Topology :
  - Bus Topology : Backbone,Single Cable.
                   Limitations: Single break of Wire.               
  - Ring Topology : Connect on 2 Sides. Limitaions : Send Data from A to D , NEED TO GO THROUGH B AND C.
  - STAR Topology : Limitation: if Central Hub Fails, entire Network get failed.
  - Tree Topology : Star + Bus. Limitation: Fault Tolerance
  - Mesh Topology : Ring Extension. connect with every System. Limitation :Expensive (wires)
  
15. OSI Layer(Open : Structure of Network
    1.Application Layer.
    2.
